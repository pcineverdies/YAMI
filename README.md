# YAMI: Yet, Antoher Monkey Interpreter

## What is monkey?

Monkey is a programming language invented by Thorsten Ball for his books [Writing an Interpreter in GO](https://interpreterbook.com) and [Writing a Compiler in GO](https://compilerbook.com).

I studied and appreciated the first one, so I re-wrote the interpreter in Python. I'll extend the language with some other features. 

## How to use it

There are two ways to use monkey:
- REPL: exectuing the script `monkey.py` without arguments, you will get a promt (`>>`) where you can write monkey code;
- file: if you specify a file path as an argument, you can execute it. Some examples are in `_Test/`.

## Changelog

**V. 1.0**: The interpreter in working with all the starting features presented in the book.
